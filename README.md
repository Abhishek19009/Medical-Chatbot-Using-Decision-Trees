DSE_19009_Abhishek_MainNotebook.ipynb

Former contains all necessary code implementations regarding the model including extracting and processing the data, building
the Decision Tree and model learning.

Latter simply calls the functions described in former and executes them.
This is done to avoid cluttering in the main execution script.

All of the data used in this project lies under the 'datasets' directory.
